## How to pay attention

- Don't multitask. Pay attention to one task at a time.
  - When writing, pay attention to the idea flow, what you want the words to mean. Don't pay attention to what the words actually mean.
  - When proofreading, pay attention to what the words are saying, and not what you think they mean.
  - Pay attention only to what you must and don't pay attention to anything else, because attention is very precious.
- Routinize things that can be routinized, such as food, water, clothes...
- Wear only one outfit ever, like Steve Jobs. Eat only one meal plan, buy exactly the same kind of groceries, or better, always eat the first vegan meal plan at the canteen.
- Use the[Zeigarnik effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect) to your advantage.
  - If you want something to stop intruding on your mind, write it down and promise yourself that you'll "deal with it later". If you want to keep pondering something (perhaps a problem you want to solve), don't write it down, and go for a walk with that problem on your mind.

## How to make literature notes

- As mentioned before, each literature note contains exactly two parts: the content of a text, and the bibliographical location of the text. If you do the note in a bibliography software like Zotero, you can attach the note directly to the text, and there's no need for the bibliography information.
- The most important thing is to capture **your** understanding of the text, so don't quote. Quoting can easily lead to out-of-context quoting. Preserve the context as much as possible by paraphrasing.
- Prepare the literature notes so that when you make permanent notes, you can elaborate on the texts, that is, describe the context, find connections and contrasts and contradictions with other texts.

## How to make permanent notes

- Recontexutalize ideas in **your** thought. Write down why you would care about an idea. For example (from section 11.2), if the idea is an observation from (Mullainathan and Shafir, 2013,  __Scarcity: Why having too little means so much__ ):
  - people with almost no time or money sometimes do things that don’t seem to make any sense...
  - People facing deadlines sometimes switch frantically between all kinds of tasks.
  - People with little money sometimes spend it on seeming luxuries like take-away food.
- Then
  - As someone with a sociological perspective on political questions and an interest in the project of a theory of society, my first note reads plainly:
  - Any comprehensive analysis of social inequality must include the cognitive effects of scarcity. Cf. Mullainathan and Shafir 2013.

## How to link between notes

- There are three kinds of links between notes:
  - Index -> Entry point note
  - Note -> Note
  - Note <-> Note
- At the top level, there is one note called "Index". The index note is just a list of tags/keywords with links. Each tag/keyword is a topic that **you** care about and is linked to a few notes (Luhmann limited himself to at most 2) that serve as "entry points" to the topic.
- The entry points are often notes that give overviews of the topic. Luhmann would make these notes to be an annotated list of notes that cover various aspects of the topic. His entry-point notes would have a list length up to 25.
- Between notes, there are two kinds of links: sequential and horizontal. In fact, sequential links are really just horizontal links that you annotate as "sequential".
- The advantage of marking some links as sequential is that you get clear sequences of thought that you can easily follow, but they are by no means essential. You could just make horizontal links.
- Ideally, you should make the network of slip-box notes to be like a [Small World Property](../Small World Property.md) , with a few notes having many connections and some notes having "weak ties" to far-away notes (Granovetter, Mark S, 1977 _The Strength of Weak Ties_).
- How to write a paper
  - Don't brainstorm, since brainstormed ideas are what's easily available, instead of innovative or actually relevant. Especially don't group-brainstorm, which tend to become even less innovative due to groupthink effects (Mullen, Brian, Craig Johnson, and Eduardo Salas, 1991, _Productivity Loss in Brainstorming Groups: A Meta-Analytic Integration_).
  - Instead, do a walk through the ^^slip-box^^ and select a linear path. That gives you a draft from which you can polish into a paper.
  - Work on several papers simultaneously, switch if bored. This is a kind of "slow multitasking", which is good ^^multitasking^^.
  - Luhmann said
    - When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else... I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.
  - When you need to cut out something that you really like, but just doesn't belong to the paper (such as something that is not relevant to the argument), you can make a file named "maybe later.txt" and dump all the things that you promise to add back later (but never actually do). This is a psychological trick that works.

## How to start the habit of using slip-boxes

- Old habits die hard. The best way to break an old habit is to make a new habit that can hopefully replace the old habit.
- For getting into the habit of using slip-boxes, you can start by making literature notes. Once you have that habit, making permanent notes would be a natural next habit to take on.
